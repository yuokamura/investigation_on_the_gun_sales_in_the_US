# investigation_on_the_gun_sales_in_the_US

In this project, the overall trend of gun purchases in the U.S. will be investigated, both nation-wise and the state-wise trend. Following that, the potential factors which contribute to the general gun sale will be investigated.

# Dataset
The first data set ('gun_data.xlsx') comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). This data is used by gun shops to determine the eligibility of a prospective firearms/explosive buyer.
The second data set ('U.S. census data.csv') is the U.S census data.
